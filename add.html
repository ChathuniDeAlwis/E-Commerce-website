        <p>On the south coast, the area around Dikwella is gradually becoming more popular with travelers looking to escape the increasing development further to the west. </p>
        <p>A string of relatively unspoiled beaches dot the coast here, most notably the stunning little horseshoe bay at Hiriketiya which is backed by a small selection of great places to stay. Try The Salty Pelican Yoga & Surf Retreat just three minutes walk from the beach. </p>

        <p class="detail">Idyllic stretch of golden sands at Bentota, Sri Lanka. Photo: Shutterstock</p>
        <p>Bentota is one of the best beaches in Sri Lanka. It sits on the west coast, runs south from magnificent Bentota lagoon and is lined with a string of alluring hotels. </p>
        <p>The southern end of the beach is home to some of the most appealing upmarket accommodation along this coastline. You'll find a number of chic boutique hotels nestled amongst the palm trees, like Centara Ceysands Resort & Spa. </p>
        <p>Bentota is also Sri Lanka's watersports hub. Behind the beach, the calm waters of the lagoon are perfect for kayaking and jet-skiing, while boat trips up the river to explore the mangroves and tangled waterways are easy to arrange. </p>
        <p>Lying halfway between major destinations such as Colombo and Galle, adding a stop off at Bentota as part of Insight Guides Sri Lanka Family Adventure trip makes perfect sense. </p>

        <h2>3. Discover beautiful Arugam Bay on the east coast</h2>

        <p class="detail">Beautiful sunset at Arugam Bay another of the best beaches in Sri Lanka. Photo: Shutterstock</p>
        <p>Towards the southern end of the east coast, the village of Arugam Bay is a popular destination with independent travelers drawn by the charms of its beautiful, palm-fringed beach. </p>
        <p>Surfers originally put the village on the map by visiting to ride what are widely thought to be some of the best waves in Sri Lanka. The beach continues to attract plenty of surfers, but its laid-back vibe and offbeat charm provide wide-ranging appeal. Tours of nearby Pottuvil Lagoon are easily arranged, as well as motor-boat trips out to sea in search of dolphins.</p>
        <p>The local community have strongly and successfully resisted the development of major hotels. But plenty of casual lodgings are available in quirky village guesthouses and relaxed beachfront bungalows and cabanas. Arne's Place is a perfect example.</p>

        <h2>4. Mirissa Beach is the south coast whale watching legend</h2>

        <p class="detail">The palm-fringed golden sands at Mirissa, Sri Lanka. Photo: Shutterstock</p>
        <p>On the south coast, the fine sands of Mirissa Beach are backed by palm trees, while its clear waters and lively waves make it ideal for both swimming and surfing. But development here has mainly been driven by Mirissa's emergence as the whale-watching capital of Sri Lanka.</p>
        <p>Numerous whales can frequently be spotted reasonably close to the shoreline. Additionally, multiple tour operators based in the village offer boat trips to see them during the season, which runs from December to April.</p>
        <p>A cluster of hotels and guesthouses offer a variety of accommodation choices close to Mirissa Beach. Try laid-back and charming Handagedara Resort just a short walk from the Indian Ocean, soft sands and possible whale sightings.         </p>

        <h2>5. Peaceful Uppuveli Beach is off the beaten track</h2>

        <p class="detail">The sleepy beachfront at Uppuveli, Sri Lanka. Photo: Shutterstock        </p>
        <p>Just north of Trincomalee on the east coast, the sleepy village of Uppuveli is a great option if you want one of the best beaches in Sri Lanka, but well off the beaten track.</p>
        <p>Proximity to the former civil war zone means that the seemingly endless swathes of soft white sand lining the coast remain remarkably unspoiled. Although the area is beginning to develop a reputation as a center for whale-watching and diving.</p>
        <p>Development is happening gradually and Uppuveli now has a reasonable selection of guesthouses and casual hotels Elegant Green Beach Resort just a few minutes walk from the sleepy beachfront. </p>
